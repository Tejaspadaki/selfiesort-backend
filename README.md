## üì∏ Photo Matching Backend (Flask + S3 + DeepFace)

This is a Flask-based backend for a **face recognition photo matching system**. It allows:

* üì§ Uploading a folder of images (e.g., wedding/event photos) directly to **AWS S3**
* ü§≥ Uploading a **selfie** to match against the uploaded images using **face embeddings**
* üß† Face detection powered by **DeepFace (ArcFace model)**
* üìÇ Organized storage in S3 (uploaded folders and matched folders)
* üîó All output URLs are S3-generated public/pre-signed links

---

## üß† Features

* Upload photos from photographers directly to AWS S3
* Automatically extract embeddings using `DeepFace`
* Cluster using `DBSCAN` (unsupervised clustering)
* Upload matched images to a separate folder (`matched-selfies/`) in S3
* Serve results through a JSON API (ready for frontend integration)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* `Flask`
* `DeepFace` (ArcFace)
* `DBSCAN` from `sklearn`
* `AWS S3` for file storage
* `Boto3` (AWS SDK for Python)
* `CORS` for frontend API access

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
üì¶ backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                # Main Flask API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ s3_utils.py           # AWS S3 helper functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt      # Dependencies
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. üß± Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/photo-matching-backend.git
cd photo-matching-backend
```

### 2. üêç Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv faceenv
source faceenv/bin/activate     # On Windows: faceenv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. üì¶ Install Dependencies

Make sure your Python version is 3.9 or 3.10 (avoid 3.11+ due to DeepFace issues).

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> üí° If you face issues with `tensorflow` or `numpy`, you may need to tweak version numbers. Let me know and I‚Äôll adjust them for your OS/CPU/GPU.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AWS S3 Configuration

### Set these environment variables in your shell or `.env` file:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-south-1         # e.g. Mumbai
export S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
```

If using a `.env`, install `python-dotenv` and load it from `s3_utils.py`.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Flask Server

```bash
python app.py
```

API will be available at: `http://localhost:5000/`
